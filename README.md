### Problem Statement
<p>
I need to code Objective C to create iOS/macOS native applications. <br>
Problem with Apple's ecosystem prices are rediculous. I am not paying top dollar for piece of shit hardware. My MSi GV62-8rd will be a strong contester in this battle.
  
<br>
What is my specifications and expectations? <br>
<br>
- my NVME SSD needs to work <br>
- Needs to duel boot with Windows <br>
- My GTX 1050ti needs to work<br>
- My sound/bluetooth needs to be working<br>
